# Momoh Beauty E-commerce Website

Welcome to the Momoh Beauty E-commerce Website! This project is a modern, scalable online store built with **Next.js**, **Supabase**, and **Redis**, designed to showcase luxurious yet affordable skincare and beauty products (e.g., Lip Oil Balms, Phone Pouches, Sets).
